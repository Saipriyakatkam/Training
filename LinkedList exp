Node consist of data and pointer

1)Adding the element at the end

Declare a structure variable (temp)of same and point it to the head pointer 
Traverse the temp variable until (temp->next ==NULL) is null.
if it is null add the E data node

2)adding at first

Add the new node next to head( new->next) to head of the list
and make the new as head.

3)Adding After B

Declare a structure variable (temp) and point it to the head

traverse through the list and compare the data part of temp with the data 'B'
(temp->data=='B')

-add new node next to temp next(newnode->next=temp->next)
-add new node to temp next (temp->next=newnode)
